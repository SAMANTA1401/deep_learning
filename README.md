Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch are all machine learning frameworks with different uses and features: 

Scikit-learn
An open-source Python library for traditional machine learning tasks like classification, regression, and clustering. It's widely used in academia and industry. Scikit-learn is good for defining algorithms, but it's not designed for end-to-end training of deep neural networks. 

TensorFlow
An open-source Python library that specializes in deep learning and neural networks. It's widely used in industry, especially for deep learning tasks. TensorFlow is known for its optimization and hardware acceleration. 

PyTorch
A deep learning software library for Python, C++, and Julia. It's designed for deep learning and has a dynamic and intuitive development experience. PyTorch is more dynamic than TensorFlow, allowing users to execute nodes as the model runs. 
Other differences include: 
Keras: A high-level API for TensorFlow and PyTorch that's widely used in both academia and industry. 
Level of abstraction: Scikit-learn has a higher level of abstraction for common machine learning algorithms than TensorFlow. 
Ease of use: Scikit-learn is generally easier to use than PyTorch. 
Programming paradigms: MXNet provides flexibility regarding programming paradigms.
